                Terms and conditions typically have a short description of your
                privacy policy or a statement declaring that using the site

                personal data. It has survived not only five centuries but also

                recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker

                While it’s not legally required for ecommerce websites to have a
                terms and conditions agreement, adding one will help protect
                your online business. As terms and conditions are legally
                enforceable rules, they allow you to set standards for how users
                interact with your site. Here are some of the major benefits of
                including terms and conditions on your ecommerce site:
